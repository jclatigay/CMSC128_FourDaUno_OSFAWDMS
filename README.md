Office of Scholarship and Financial Assistance WEBSITE, DATABASE, AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

The OSFAWDMS is a website system that provides users (admins and students) with a variety of features such as user account management, search functionality, website notifications, website tracking, and more. The application is intended for use by UPB students and OSFA admins that are connected to the Local Access Network (LAN).

The primary objective of the OSFAWDMS project is to create a website that is easy to use, maintainable, and reliable. The projectâ€™s range of features and functions will enable users to browse all OSFA-related information quickly and easily according to their needs.

The OSFAWDMS project encompasses the development of a website-based mix of information and membership platform that includes features such as scholar search, scholar catalog, scholar management, scholarship catalog, scholarship management, OSFA information catalog, OSFA information management, and  scholarship eligibility tracker. The website is intended for UPB students who are interested in scholarships and OSFA services, as well as by the OSFA admins responsible for managing the website.
